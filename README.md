# Laelaps2_DDPG
Laelaps II training for slope handling using Gazebo, ROS and Gym. Work by A. S. Mastrogeorgiou and Yehia S. Elbahrawy.

Laelaps II is a quadruped robot built by the Legged Team at the Control Systems Lab of NTUA
(http://nereus.mech.ntua.gr/legged/)

This work focuses on how from trajectory planning on toe level and open loop stability as a starting point, it is possible to
develop a controller using deep RL that enables Laelaps II quadruped to handle positive and negative slopes.
